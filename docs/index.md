# santa-lang

An functional, C-like programming language for solving Advent of Code puzzles.

_Influenced by:_ Rust, Python, Clojure, F#, Scala

## Why?

Over the past several years I have been slowly working through the previous Advent of Code calendars.
For each calendar I opt to solve the puzzles in a new programming language, to familiarise myself with other ways of understanding and working.
However, there comes a time in each calendar that I grow to dislike some aspect of the language.
So I had an idea... why not give this whole programming langauge design a go.
That way if I grow to dislike this language, I only have myself to blame!

Welcome **santa-lang**, my [tree-walking interpreted](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)>) programming language designed to help tackle Advent of Code puzzles.
