# Examples

Over the course of development I have used the language in several different projects:

## Advent of Code 2022

As documented on [my blog](https://eddmann.com/posts/solving-the-advent-of-code-2022-calendar-using-my-own-programming-language-santa-lang/), I was able to complete the entire 2022 calendar using the language.
All solutions can be found within my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2022/santa-lang).

## Advent of Code 2018

During development, I used the 2018 calendar as a test-bed to exercise functionality designed within the language.
All solutions can be found within my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2018/santa-lang).

## Secret Santa 2022

Each year I decide to formulate a _weird n' wacky_ way in which to allocate Secret Santa's for my family.
For 2022 I used an AWS Step Function workflow with many different runtimes, one of which was santa-lang.
The complete workflow can be seen within my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/eddmann/step-function-secret-santa).
